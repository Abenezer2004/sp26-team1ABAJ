#Allan_Holtz

## My name is Allan Holtz but I go by Aj, I'm interested in sports, games, anime and other shows. I'm interested in computer science mainly because it is interesting as a field and my family is involved in it.

## My CSC340 goals are too understand more about software engineering and the what goes into software engineering conceptually and what software engineers do on a day to day basis.
