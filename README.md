## Description 
>The Nurse Search app connects customers who want to hire a stay-at-home nurse for various needs, such as caring for an elderly parent, a partner who requires assistance, or any other personal care situation. The app helps match customers with nurses who have the required qualifications and a price range that both parties agree on.

> The app is motivated by a desire to help people especially elderly individuals who may prefer to communicate in a different language. Nurse Search allows users to find nurses who speak their preferred language, making care more comfortable and accessible. The goal of the app is to make the process of finding a stay-at-home nurse as simple and accessible as possible. We aim to provide the best possible experience for both customers and providers so that both parties have a positive experience using the app.
